I like having icons instead of text in my blog's navbar. I use the [iconify
extenion](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-iconify) for icons but when I was
first adding icons to my blog I noticed the **hover text** from my browser was
not helpful.

![The default hover text is just the full name/description of the image.](./img/before.png){width=450}

Upon reading the `iconify` README, I learned I can control hover text with a
title key. E.g.:

``` markdown
# note the title key in the line below
{{{< iconify ph:lightbulb-bold title=TIL label=TIL size=Large >}}}
```

The snippet above would create hover text like this {{< iconify ph:arrow-fat-down-fill >}}.

![After setting the `title` key, the hover text is much more useful.](./img/after.png){width=450}
