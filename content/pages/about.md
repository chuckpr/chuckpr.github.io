My name is Chuck Pepe-Ranney and I am a microbial genomics data scientist
at AgBiome. Prior to AgBiome is was a post-doctoral researcher at Cornell
University in [Dan Buckley's lab](https://blogs.cornell.edu/buckley/),
a teaching fellow for four summers on the
[Microbial Diversity Course](https://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/microbial-diversity/)
(Wood's Hole, Massachusetts), and a student at the
[Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/).

The title of this blog says it all and I hope to share some solutions to data
science problems in the microbial genomics domain I've encountered in my
career.
